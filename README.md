Trofers is a minecraft mod that adds customizable trophies, which can be added using data packs.
The data pack that comes with the mod includes a trophy for every non-boss mob, entities have a small chance to drop these when killed by a player.
(The drop rate can be changed in the config)

## Customizing Trophies

Trophy JSONs are placed in the `data/<namespace>/trofers` folder. The following fields can be customized 
(all fields are optional unless stated otherwise):

* `name`: The name of the trophy as a text component (can be a string). 
  Information on how to format these can be found [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format).
* `tooltip`: A list of text components, one component per line
* `item`: An object describing the item the trophy should display. Contains the following fields:
  * `item`: (_required_) The item ID
  * `count`: The size of the item stack
  * `nbt`: The NBT of the item stack, either as a JSON object or stringified NBT
* `entity`: An object describing the entity the trophy should display. Contains the following fields:

  * `speed`: Affects the speed of the animation
* `colors`: An object describing the colors of the trophy base

    or as an object with `red`/`green`/`blue` fields between 0 and 255.
* `effects`: An object describing effects that should apply when the trophy is right-clicked
  * `sound`: A sound to play when the trophy is right-clicked
    * `soundEvent`: A sound event ID
    * `volume`: (_default = 1_) the volume to play the sound event at
    * `pitch`: (_default = 1_) the pitch to play the sound event at

    * `statusEffect`: A potion effect to apply to the player
      * `effect`: (_required_) The effect ID
      * `duration`: (_required_) The amount of time in ticks the effect should last

For example trophies see the [default data pack](https://github.com/ochotonida/trofers/tree/HEAD/common/src/generated/resources/data/trofers/trofers).

## Adding a trophy to a trophy base
Trofers currently adds 6 trophy bases. 
Placing one down and right-clicking it while in creative will open a menu that allows you to pick any existing trophy.
You can also set the trophy by changing the item's NBT: `{BlockEntityTag:{Trophy:"namespace:path"}}`.
Changes made to your data pack will apply to any existing trophies.

## Making entities drop trophies
Because overriding loot tables can be annoying, Trofers adds a loot modifier which can be used to make entities drop trophies.

*Note: the data pack format for this loot modifier has changed in update 3.0.0, the 1.18 README can be found [here](https://github.com/ochotonida/trofers/blob/1.18/README.md).*

The loot modifier should be placed in the `data/<namespace>/loot_modifiers` folder and uses the following structure:

* `"type": "trofers:add_entity_trophy"`: required, this tells forge which loot modifier type to use
* `conditions`: A list of loot conditions that determine when to apply the loot modifier. Trofers uses a `minecraft:killed_by_player` and a `trofers:random_trophy_chance` condition here. The `random_trophy_chance` condition ensures the loot modifier is applied with the trophy chance value specified in the config.
* `trophyBase`: The ID of an item to use as the trophy base. (e.g. "trofers:small_plate")
* `trophies`: An object with multiple key-value pairs. Each key should correspond with an entity type id, and its value the id of the trophy it should drop. (Note: for entities that can drop multiple trophies you will need multiple loot modifier files)

If all trophies have the same drop conditions, you only need a single file.

[Example loot modifiers](https://github.com/ochotonida/trofers/tree/HEAD/common/src/generated/resources/data/trofers/loot_modifiers)

After creating your loot modifier you need to register it to forge, more information on how to register a loot modifier (and loot modifiers in general) found [here](https://forge.gemwire.uk/wiki/Dynamic_Loot_Modification). (The wiki page is mostly aimed at mod developers, you can ignore the last section)

[Example registration](https://github.com/ochotonida/trofers/blob/HEAD/common/src/generated/resources/data/forge/loot_modifiers/global_loot_modifiers.json)

## Adding trophies to any loot table
If you want to add trophies to chests rather than entities, you can use the `add_trophy` loot modifier.
This loot modifier is a bit different from the `add_entity_trophy` loot modifier, as you will need a separate loot modifier file for every trophy.

* `"type": "trofers:add_trophy"`: required.
* `conditions`: A list of loot conditions that determine when to apply the loot modifier.
  To prevent the trophy from being generated when any loot table is rolled, you likely want to use a `forge:loot_table_id` condition here.
* `trophyBase`: The ID of an item to use as the trophy base.
* `trophyId`: An object with multiple key-value pairs. Each key should correspond with an entity type id, and its value the id of the trophy it should drop. (Note: for entities that can drop multiple trophies you will need multiple loot modifier files)

Example: The following loot modifier will add a creeper trophy to buried treasure chests with a 50% chance.
```json5
{
  "type": "trofers:add_trophy",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "condition": "forge:loot_table_id",
      "loot_table_id": "minecraft:chests/buried_treasure"
    },
    {
      "chance": 0.5,
      "condition": "minecraft:random_chance"
    }
  ],
  "trophyBase": "trofers:small_plate",
  "trophyId": "trofers:creeper"
}
```
